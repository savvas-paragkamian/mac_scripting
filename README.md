# Mac scripting

This repository contains scripts for the automation of macos system functions, application tasks and new mac setup.

## Mac initiation

Mac initiation is possible through HomeBrew. The inspiration comes from Corey Schafer [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/dotfiles). A bash script can help install the basic applications and programming tools. This is a semiautomatic process which is similar to container build files. I split the procedure in 2 distinct parts: applications and programming environment.

### Programming

Programming is diveded in 3 sections

1. coding environment (git, tmux, vim and their source files from my repos to symlink)
2. programming languages and packages
3. utilities

### Applications

1. Install HomeBrew from the website
2. git clone this repository
3. run the `brew` script


### notes for apps installations
djvu app is not in brew
adobe bridge is not in brew
dictionary for greek 
affinity and pixelmator
speedtest

## Backup notes

The script backups all my notes from the `Notes.app`. Greek fonts are not recognised.
