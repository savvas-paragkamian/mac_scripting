# Mac scripting

This repository contains scripts for the automation of macos and application tasks. Also it contains script for the initiation of new macs. The inspiration comes from Corey Schafer [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/dotfiles).

## Mac initiation

Mac initiation is possible through HomeBrew. A bash script can help install the basic applications and programming tools. This is a semiautomatic process which is similar to container build files. I split the procedure in 2 distinct parts: applications and programming environment.

### Applications

1. Install HomeBrew from the website
2. git clone this repository
3. run the `brew` script

djvu app is not in brew
adobe bridge is not in brew
dictionary for greek 
affinity and pixelmator
speedtest

### Programming environment

1. Set git
* global credentials and tools
* clone my dot files repositories
2. Create symlinks of source files of vim, tmux, bash and zsh
3. Latex
4. R and packages
